  * cl-who
  * cl-store

and for the demo:

  * ch-asdf

2. Install the nuclblog.asd file

Install the nuclblog.asd file in the usual place .asd
files go on your system (e.g., /usr/local/lib/sbcl/site-systems)

3. Running the demo

execute the following:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :nuclblog-demo)
(nuclblog-demo:start-services)
(nuclblog::add-user nuclblog-demo::*blog* "demo" "demo")

and you should be ready to go!

4. SSL

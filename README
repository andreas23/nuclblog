nuclblog is a rewrite of Brian Mastenbrook's cl-blog. The main reasons
for rewriting this are to simplify the code a bit and to support
hunchentoot (and possibly to use UCW) instead of araneida.

CSS

We would like to support arbitrary designs for blog pages using
CSS. To do so we will emit HTML ids and classes that allow for the
visual layout to be specified with CSS rules.

Main Page:

header
nav
content

box
box-head
box-context

nuclblog is a rewrite of Brian Mastenbrook's cl-blog. The main reasons
for rewriting this are to simplify the code a bit and to support
hunchentoot (and possibly to use UCW) instead of araneida.

To install it you need to do/get the following:

1. Prerequisites:

  * hunchentoot
  * cl-who
  * cl-store

and for the demo:

  * ch-asdf

2. Install the nuclblog.asd file

Install the nuclblog.asd file in the usual place .asd
files go on your system (e.g., /usr/local/lib/sbcl/site-systems)

3. Running the demo

execute the following:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :nuclblog-demo)
(nuclblog-demo:start-services)
(nuclblog::add-user nuclblog-demo::*blog* "demo" "demo")

and you should be ready to go!

4. SSL

To create a new cert:

openssl genrsa -out key.pem 1024      
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out request.pem
openssl req -x509 -days 30 -key key.pem -in request.pem -out certificate.pem

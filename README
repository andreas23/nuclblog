nuclblog is a rewrite of Brian Mastenbrook's cl-blog. The main reasons
for rewriting this are to simplify the code a bit and to support
hunchentoot (and possibly to use UCW) instead of araneida.

To install it you need to do/get the following:

1. Prerequisites:

  * hunchentoot
  * cl-who
  * cl-store

and for the demo:

  * ch-asdf

2. Install the nuclblog.asd file

Install the nuclblog.asd file in the usual place .asd
files go on your system (e.g., /usr/local/lib/sbcl/site-systems)

3. Running the demo

cd to the demo directory and file the directions in demo/README.

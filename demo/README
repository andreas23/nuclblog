nuclblog-demo


To run the demo blog, do the following:


(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :nuclblog-demo)
(nuclblog-demo:start-services)
(nuclblog::add-user nuclblog-demo::*blog* "demo" "demo")


This will start up a hunchentoot instance running on port 4242. You'll
be open to the world if you run it like this, so you might want to
choose a different password, but that should get you started.
